<h2>☁️ Overview</h2>
<p>Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you play any time and anywhere as long as you have our appliction &#128516 Tic-tac-toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, then neither player will win. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play but win the majority of the time. If you want to know how to play tic-tac-toe, then see Step 1 to get started.
I use my simple array collection of winning o/p and on the we write O(1) time complexity alogorithem and use set-timeout and modal functionality in the project </p>
